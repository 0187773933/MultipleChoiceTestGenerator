## Which of the following best describes the purpose of a catalyst?

CHOICES

- Catalysts are used up in the reaction, increasing reaction efficiency
- Catalysts increase the rate of the reaction by lowering the activation energy.
- Catalysts alter the thermodynamics of the reaction to facilitate the formation of products or reactants.
- Catalysts stabilize the transition state by bringing it to a higher energy.

ANSWER = B

- By definition, a catalyst increases the rate of a reaction by lowering the activation energy , making it easier for both the forward and reverse
	reactions to overcome this energy barrier.
- Catalysts are neither used up in the reaction, nor do they alter the equilibrium of a reaction, eliminating (A) and (C).
- Finally, catalysts stabilize the transition state by lowering its energy, not raising it, eliminating (D).

## The following system obeys second-order kinetics

What is the rate law for this reaction ?

CHOICES

- rate = $k[NO_2][CO]$
- rate = $k[NO_2]^2[CO]$
- rate = $k[NO_2][NO_3]$
- rate = $k[NO_2]^2$

ANSWER = D

- To answer this question , recall that the slow step of a reaction is the rate-determining step.
- The rate is always related to the concentrations of the reactants in the rate-determining step ( not the overall reaction )
	- so $NO2$ is the only compound that should be included in the correct answer. 
- The concentration of $NO2$ is squared in the rate law because the question stem tells us that the system obeys second-order kinetics.

Assuming identical conditions, which of the reactions displayed on the energy diagram proceeds the fastest?

CHOICES

- A
- B
- C
- D

ANSWER = D

- The faster a reaction can reach its activation energy, the faster it will proceed to completion.
- Because this question states that all conditions are equal, the reaction with the lowest activation energy will have the fastest rate.
- In the diagram, (D) has the lowest activation energy.
